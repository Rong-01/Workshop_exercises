# Workshop_exercises
This repository contains the shiny app for the exercises in the workshop. The original shiny app written with R were provided by Lorenzo. 
I placed them at Github and published them at Posit Connect cloud to deploy those shiny apps this year for the workshop in the ecology course.
The folder is structured in the order of exercises.
